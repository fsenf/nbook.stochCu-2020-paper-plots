## Paper
This is a collection of jupyter notebooks that have been used to prepare plots for a paper project. 

Sakradzija, M., F. Senf, L. Scheck, M. Ahlgrimm, and D. Klocke (2020), **Local impact of stochastic shallow convection on clouds and precipitation in the tropical Atlantic**, under review to Mon. Wea. Rev

## Dependencies

* `numpy`
* `pylab`
* `xarray`
* `tropy`
* `nawdex_analysis`

The notebook still use a python 2.7 kernel!

Some Notebooks depend on my work tools from the `tropy` package which are collected here [https://github.com/fsenf/proj.tropy](https://github.com/fsenf/proj.tropy)

Much of the analysis is based on a python package `nawdex_analysis` that was developed for another analysis (CRE over the North Atlantic). The package is found [https://github.com/fsenf/proj.nawdex_analysis](https://github.com/fsenf/proj.nawdex_analysis)

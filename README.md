# Jupyter Notebooks for Plotting Analysis of the "Stochastic Shallow Convection in the tropical Atlantic" study

## Paper
This is a collection of jupyter notebooks that have been used to prepare plots for a paper project. 

Authors, Title, ... (will be added later)

## Dependencies

* `numpy`
* `pylab`
* `xarray`
* `tropy`
* `nawdex_analysis`


Some Notebooks depend on my work tools from the `tropy` package which are collected here [https://github.com/fsenf/proj.tropy](https://github.com/fsenf/proj.tropy)

Much of the analysis is based on a python package that was developed for another analysis (CRE over the North Atlantic). The package is found [https://github.com/fsenf/proj.nawdex_analysis](https://github.com/fsenf/proj.nawdex_analysis)
